SQL Database Analysis - Jifunz Business Data

This script contains a series of SQL queries designed to explore and extract meaningful insights from the Jifunz sample database. The analysis covers key business areas including:

1.  **Customer Insights:** Understanding customer demographics (location, count per country) and spending habits (total and average order amounts).
2.  **Supplier and Product Management:** Identifying supplier locations, tracking product availability (discontinued status), categorizing products by packaging and naming conventions, and determining top product suppliers.
3.  **Order and Sales Performance:** Detailed views of customer orders, product quantities and prices within orders, and aggregated sales metrics for specific time periods.

The queries utilize various SQL concepts such as:
-   Basic SELECT, FROM, WHERE clauses for data retrieval and filtering.
-   INNER JOINs to combine data from multiple related tables (Customer, Supplier, Product, Order, OrderItem).
-   Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG) for summarizing data.
-   GROUP BY and HAVING clauses for grouping and filtering aggregated results.
-   ORDER BY for sorting results.
-   String functions (CONCAT, LIKE) for data manipulation and pattern matching.
-   CASE statements for conditional logic and data transformation.

This analysis provides foundational insights for business decision-making, covering aspects from supply chain understanding to customer behavior and sales performance.
